# Virtual Coin Toss

## Overview
This project is a simple **Virtual Coin Toss** simulator built using Python. It allows users to flip a coin multiple times, track the number of heads and tails, and visualize the results using a pie chart.

## Features
- Simulates a random coin flip (Heads/Tails)
- Allows multiple tosses in a single session
- Keeps track of total Heads and Tails count
- Displays results as a **pie chart** using Matplotlib

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for logic and randomization)
- **Matplotlib** (for data visualization)

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install Matplotlib if not already installed:
   ```sh
   pip install matplotlib
   ```
3. Download or clone this repository.

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python coin_toss.py
   ```
2. The program will display the result of each coin toss.
3. Enter '1' to flip again or any other key to exit.
4. After exiting, a pie chart will be displayed showing the distribution of Heads and Tails.

## Example Output
```
The result is Heads

Total outputs in this session:
Heads: 3
Tails: 2

Enter '1' to retoss, any other key to exit: 1
```
